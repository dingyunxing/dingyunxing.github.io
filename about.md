## A bit of me

My name is James(Chinese: 云星, Pronunciation: [Yun](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Yun)[-Xing](https://www.pronouncenames.com/search?name=Xing)) Ding. I am a data scientist and a machine learning engineer who loves all the techniques around "Big Data". I am passionate about coding and always embracing the open source community. 

I am currently working as a machine learning enginner [@Stroër Labs](https://jobs.stroeer-labs.com/new-zealand/) based in Christchurch, New Zealand. I am also living here with my wife and a cute boy.

## Why this blog

This blog is a record of my life and learning path to be a dev. It also serves the purpose of helping people with similar issues as I had. I wish this blog could witness every step I take towards becoming a giant, and help many others to grow and make progress with me.
